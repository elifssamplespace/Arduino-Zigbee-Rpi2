# Arduino-Zigbee-Rpi2
This is example of Xbee series2-Api mode application. 
Communication between Arduino(End) and Raspberry Pi2 (Coordinatior) It is very basic and performs sending and reveicing process but easy to adapt other embedded systems' spesifications (The logic is the same, libraries are different)
